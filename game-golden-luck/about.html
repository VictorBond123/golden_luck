    <h1>How to Play "GifMaze Expedition"</h1>

    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Find all matching pairs of cards by flipping them over two at a time and memorizing
        their locations.</p>

    <p><strong>Getting Started:</strong> Click on any card to reveal its image. Then, select another card to uncover its
        image.</p>

    <p><strong>Finding a Pair:</strong> Open cards one by one, attempting to match them with their pairs. If the images
        on two open cards match, they remain open. If not, both cards are flipped back over.</p>

    <p><strong>Memorization is Key:</strong> Remember the positions of the cards to increase your chances of finding
        matching pairs.</p>

    <p><strong>Game End:</strong> Continue until all pairs are successfully matched. Your goal is to complete the game
        with the fewest moves possible.</p>
